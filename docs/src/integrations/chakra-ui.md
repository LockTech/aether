# Chakra UI

Aether's user interface has been implemented using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

## Form Components

Provided in the `web/src/components/Forms` directory are components which combine [RedwoodJS' form components](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/forms) with [Chakra UI's](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components#form).

> As of writing, this integration is incomplete, and should eventually be extracted out into a library. Progress on this can be tracked [via the Aether repository](https://github.com/LockTech/aether/issues/3).
