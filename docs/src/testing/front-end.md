# Front-end

On the web, Aether focuses on making use of [Storybook](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/storybook) to develop and test the UI. Instead of relying on data existing in the database at a particular point in time, [GraphQL operations can be mocked](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/testing#mocking-graphql-calls) â€” and API-tests used to assert these mocked values align with its implementation.
