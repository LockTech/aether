# Configuration

See [Aether's `.env.defaults`](https://github.com/LockTech/aether/blob/main/.env.defaults) for a list of the [environment variables](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/environment-variables) which the boilerplate supports for configuration.

> During development (`yarn rw dev`), only variables including the character-sequence `...` are required.
