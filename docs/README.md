# Aether Documentation

This directory contains the [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) used to provide the Aether boilerplate's documentation. **You can safely delete this directory** if you're only using the boilerplate to create an application.

You will find an up-to-date version of this documentation [here]().
